# Code organization

 - Functions are included in the functions folder. The script to run use these functions, so they do not need to be run directly (just loaded into the script that uses them)
 - Scripts to run are located in the main code directory.
 
 # Script order
 Run the scripts in this order:
 1. run_sims : Sets up and runs the simulations, creates the summary of results
 2. plot_results: Manipulates the output to meaningful forms and creates plots.
